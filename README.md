<h1 style="text-align: center;">LA's Best Client</h1>

# Breakdown
I create my Restaurant Client to work with my Restaurant API to create display and store your favorite restaurants. I also added a feature that lets you create a review for each restaurant.

# User Stories
As a friend, I want to see Andrew's favorite restaurants in LA.

As a food reviewer, I want to have a place to save my work & look back at prior restaurants.

As a User I want to write a review so that I can remember what is good at the places near me.

As a developer, I want the User Experience to shine & make sure that buttons and flows are intuitive & easy to use.
